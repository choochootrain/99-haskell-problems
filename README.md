99 Haskell Problems
===================

1. Find the last element of a list.
2. Find the last but one element of a list.
3. Find the K'th element of a list. The first element in the list is number 1.
4. Find the number of elements of a list.
5. Reverse a list.
6. Find out whether a list is a palindrome. A palindrome can be read forward or backward.
7. Flatten a nested list structure.
8. Eliminate consecutive duplicates of list elements.
9. Pack consecutive duplicates of list elements into sublists. If a list contains repeated elements they should be placed in separate sublists.
10. Run-length encoding of a list. Use the result of problem P09 to implement the so-called run-length encoding data compression method. Consecutive duplicates of elements are encoded as lists (N E) where N is the number of duplicates of the element E.
