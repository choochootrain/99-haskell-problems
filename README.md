99 Haskell Problems
===================

1. Find the last element of a list.
2. Find the last but one element of a list.
3. Find the K'th element of a list. The first element in the list is number 1.
4. Find the number of elements of a list.
5. Reverse a list.
6. Find out whether a list is a palindrome. A palindrome can be read forward or backward.
7. Flatten a nested list structure.
8. Eliminate consecutive duplicates of list elements.
9. Pack consecutive duplicates of list elements into sublists. If a list contains repeated elements they should be placed in separate sublists.
10. Run-length encoding of a list. Use the result of problem P09 to implement the so-called run-length encoding data compression method. Consecutive duplicates of elements are encoded as lists (N E) where N is the number of duplicates of the element E.
11. Modified run-length encoding. Modify the result of problem 10 in such a way that if an element has no duplicates it is simply copied into the result list. Only elements with duplicates are transferred as (N E) lists.
12. Decode a run-length encoded list. Given a run-length code list generated as specified in problem 11. Construct its uncompressed version.
13. Run-length encoding of a list (direct solution). Implement the so-called run-length encoding data compression method directly. I.e. don't explicitly create the sublists containing the duplicates, as in problem 9, but only count them. As in problem P11, simplify the result list by replacing the singleton lists (1 X) by X.
14. Duplicate the elements of a list.
15. Replicate the elements in a list a given number of times.
16. Drop every N'th element from a list.
17. Split a list into two parts; the length of the first part is given. Do not use any defined predicates.
18. Extract a slice from a list. Given two indices, i and k, the slice is the list containing the elements between the i'th and k'th element of the original list (both limits included). Start counting the elements with 1.
19. Rotate a list N places to the left.
20. Remove the K'th element from a list.
21. Insert an element at a given position into a list.
22. Create a list containing all integers within a given range.
